# SleepMemMRI
(In progress) I am currently analyzing fMRI data from a reinforcement learning paradigm as part of my Master's thesis. Here, I first perform first and second level analyses of the data. In a next step, I  check out brain areas that are activated for my contrasts of interest. Lastly, I extract activation values for each subject for select areas. I can then correlate these individual activations with behavioral parameters from the paradigm, to see which areas are related to behavior.
In a next step, I would like to do a similar analysis looking at connectivity between areas.
